The materials give learners things to do and a chance to think for themselves. They are designed to be fun. Learners can make mistakes but can try again. There is plenty of in-built help if they get stuck and opportunities to go back and revise. Many of the materials include games or quizzes. Accessibility options are available on many of the materials to suit learners\' individual needs. The materials are also designed to appeal to the different learning styles of students.

This activity module allows teachers to find and add NLN learning objects to their Moodle courses with a minimum of effort.';
